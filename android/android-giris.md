* To install Android Studio, go to [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) and follow the instructions to download and install it.
* When creating a new app, ensure that **API 15: Android 4.0.3 IceCreamSandwich** is set as the Minimum SDK.
* To see the app's Android hierarchy in the Project pane, click the **Project** tab in the vertical tab column, and then choose **Android** in the popup menu at the top.
* Edit the `build.gradle(Module:app)` file when you need to add new libraries to your project or change library versions.
* All code and resources for the app are located within the `app` and `res` folders. The `java` folder includes activities, tests, and other components in Java source code. The `res` folder holds resources, such as layouts, strings, and images.
* Edit the `AndroidManifest.xml` file to add features components and permissions to your Android app. All components for an app, such as multiple activities, must be declared in this XML file.
* Use the [Android Virtual Device \(AVD\) manager](http://developer.android.com/tools/devices/managing-avds.html) to create a virtual device \(also known as an emulator\) to run your app.
* Add [`Log`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Log.html) statements to your app, which display messages in the Logcat pane as a basic tool for debugging.
* To run your app on a physical Android device using Android Studio, turn on USB Debugging on the device. Open **Settings &gt; About phone** and tap **Build number** seven times. Return to the previous screen \(**Settings**\), and tap **Developer options**. Choose **USB Debugging**.
